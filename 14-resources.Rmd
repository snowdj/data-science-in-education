If you're reading this book cover to cover, by now you've been through quite a journey. 
You've learned about the unique challenges of doing data science in education, you've built up some basic coding and statistic techniques to begin developing and using an analytic routine, you've practiced your skills on education datasets, and you've worked out a plan to introduce data science into your education organization over time. So what's next? 

Like most industries, education and data science are constantly evolving moving through trends and new knowledge. That means that today's tools and best practices are tomorrow's old way. To keep up with changes, it is important develop and get comfortable with a learning routine. Sometimes this is about learning something new, sometimes this is about deepening expertise in an area you're just starting in, and other times it's about revisiting a skill you've mastered long ago. 

You'll need to use your intuition to find the areas you want to deepend your knowledge. When you feel it, go there and dive in. Remember that learning is a combination of reading, doing, talking about, walking away, and coming back. Here are more resources to help you continue on your journey: 

It's helpful to construct your own system for continuous learning. The components of this system are sources of information, learning communities, places to share your work, and a schedule to structure your learning. 

*Sources of information* 

Continuous learning about using data science at your education work place means consuming high quality books, blog posts, journals, journalism, and talks. It also means having a way that you discover new content to learn from. In his book *Steal Like An Artist*, author Austin Kleon encourages people to surround themselves with great content: 

>“There’s an economic theory out there that if you take the incomes of your five closest friends and average them, the resulting number will be pretty close to your own income. I think the same thing is true of our idea incomes. You’re only going to be as good as the stuff you surround yourself with.”

So with that in mind, here are some examples that we love. Start with these and go find more!

# Education Books

Applying data science in education, because it's new, requires that you look for best practices that can be acclerated by the tools of data science.

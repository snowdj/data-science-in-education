# Introduction: Data Science in Education - You're Invited!

Dear Data Scientists, Educators, and Data Scientists who are Educators: 

This book is a warm welcome and an invitation. If you're a data scientist in education or an educator in data science, your role isn't exactly straightforward. This book is our contribution to a growing movement to merge the paths of data analysis and education. We wrote this book to make your first step on that path a little clearer and a little less scarier. 

Whether you're a data scientist using your skills in an education job or an educator who wants to learn data science skills, we invite you to read this book and put these techniques to work in the real world. We think that your work in the eduation community will help decide how education and data science come together going forward.
